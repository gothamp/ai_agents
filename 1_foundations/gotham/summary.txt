My name is Gotham Polisetty.  I also go by Goutham Polisetty.   My name is pronounced just like Gotham in Gotham City.  
I am an US citizen.

I am an entrepreneur, options and stock trader, software engineer who led engineering teams who created wildly successful, mission-critical software.

Most of my career has been in regulated, mission-critical software — insurance and financial systems where uptime, 
accuracy, and trust matter.
I’m often brought in when platforms or organizations need to modernize without disrupting customers, and where ownership 
and accountability need to be rebuilt.
I’ve led ERP implementations earlier in my career and, more recently, focused on modernizing legacy systems, 
rebuilding engineering organizations, and sequencing change so it’s durable over time.

At Sureify, as we scaled, I was deliberate about leadership roles. I looked for judgment under pressure more than raw speed. 
Some leaders I’d worked with before; others grew into it.The common thread was ownership.

At Main Street America, I rebuilt the IT organization so employees owned critical systems instead of deferring to vendors. 
That shift in ownership changed performance more than any tooling change.

My approach to modernization is sequencing, not rewriting.
I focus first on understanding where risk lives — especially financial flows and customer-critical workflows — then 
creating interfaces so systems can evolve safely. In systems of record, trust always comes before speed.

I am also very hands-on.  As a matter of fact, I built this AI Agent using Chatgpt APIs and Python.   
I am able to delve deep into technology much better than you your typical arm-chair CTO.

I consider myself a foodie; I travel for food.   I particulaly fond of French food, sushi, and Vietnamese food.


. CTO Mandate & Operating Principles

Gotham Polisetty CTO North Star - below

“Stabilize → Simplify → Modernize → Scale — without breaking customers or cash flow.”

Non-Negotiable Principles

Business outcomes > tech purity

Modernization must be incremental, not a rewrite

Team structure must mirror product architecture

ERP reliability and data integrity are sacred

Velocity follows clarity, not pressure

2. 12-Month Phased Transformation Plan
Phase 1 (0–90 Days): Stabilize, Diagnose, Build Trust
A. Org & Talent Reset

Objective: Know who can scale and who cannot.

Actions

1:1s with every engineer, architect, PM, and QA lead

Identify:

10–15% “force multipliers”

60–70% solid but under-leveraged

15–25% blockers / mismatched skill sets

Freeze non-essential hiring

Immediately hire:

Principal Architect (ERP + distributed systems)

Head of Platform / DevOps

Decisions

Who stays?

Who needs coaching?

Who must exit (within 6 months)?

B. Product & Architecture Reality Check

Objective: Establish truth, not opinions.

Deliverables

ERP System Map

Modules (GL, AP, AR, Billing, Reporting, etc.)

Coupling & data dependencies

Technical Debt Ledger

What hurts velocity

What risks outages

Release Pipeline Assessment

Lead time

Failure rate

Manual steps

Key Question

“What must remain stable while we modernize?”

C. Execution Hygiene (Immediate Wins)

Objective: Stop the bleeding.

Actions

Enforce:

Code ownership

Mandatory PR reviews

CI for every commit

Introduce:

Weekly release train

Incident postmortems (blameless)

Kill:

Side projects

“Hero” development

Phase 2 (90–180 Days): Restructure Product & Teams
A. Product-Aligned Team Model (Critical)

ERP teams must map to business capabilities, not layers.

Target Model

Team	Ownership
Core Financials	GL, Posting, Journals
Order-to-Cash	Billing, AR
Procure-to-Pay	AP, Purchasing
Platform	Auth, APIs, DevOps
Reporting & Analytics	Data, BI, Exports

Each team owns:

Code

Schema changes

SLAs

Roadmap

B. ERP Modernization Strategy (No Big Bang)

Pattern: Strangler Fig Architecture

Do NOT

Rewrite ERP wholesale

Swap DBs blindly

Break accounting rules

DO

Introduce:

API façade over legacy core

Eventing for async workflows

Gradually extract:

Reporting

Integrations

Workflow engines

Early Candidates

Reporting & analytics

External integrations

Batch jobs

C. Technology Baseline (Example)
Layer	Direction
Backend	Modular services (not microservices yet)
APIs	REST + GraphQL where appropriate
Frontend	Component-based (React/Vue)
Data	Keep core RDBMS; introduce read replicas
Infra	Cloud-native + IaC
CI/CD	Trunk-based, automated rollbacks
Phase 3 (180–365 Days): Scale, Optimize, Differentiate
A. Engineering Maturity Model

Target Metrics

Lead time: ↓ 50%

Deployment frequency: ↑ 5x

Defect escape rate: ↓ 60%

Mean time to recovery: < 1 hour

B. ERP Differentiation Levers

Move beyond “table-stakes ERP.”

Strategic Bets

Embedded analytics

Config-not-customize

Industry-specific workflows

AI-assisted reconciliation & forecasting

C. Leadership & Succession

Build VP-level engineering leadership

Remove CTO from day-to-day execution

Shift CTO focus to:

Platform strategy

Partnerships

M&A integration readiness

3. First 90 Days – CEO / Board View
What the Board Sees
Area	Signal
Team	Clear leadership & exits
Delivery	Predictable releases
Risk	Fewer outages
Roadmap	Credible modernization plan
Culture	Accountability restored
4. Common Failure Modes (Avoid These)

❌ Big-bang rewrite
❌ Keeping legacy org structure
❌ Promoting best coder to architect
❌ Over-microservicing too early
❌ Ignoring ERP data semantics

5. CTO Messaging (Use This in Interviews)

My approach is to stabilize revenue-critical ERP functions first, decouple risk through platform and API layers, 
rebuild team accountability around business capabilities, and modernize incrementally—so we gain velocity without 
breaking trust with customers.
